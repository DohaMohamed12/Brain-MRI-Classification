# Brain MRI Classification 🧠

This project focuses on the classification of Brain MRI scans using Deep Learning techniques. The goal is to accurately identify and classify brain tumors to assist in medical diagnosis.

## 🚀 Overview
- **Objective:** Classify Brain MRI images into specific categories (e.g., Tumor vs. No Tumor or specific tumor types).
- **Tech Stack:** Python, TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch), OpenCV, and Matplotlib.
- **Dataset:** Brain MRI Images for Tumor Detection.
